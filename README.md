# MatlabCalc
A basic Wolfram|Alpha-like calculator in MATLAB, written for a final project. Menu code, "help" functions, and photo/image-related function written by Madison Dube (madison.dube@colorado.edu). All algorithms and other code by me.
Must be run in MATLAB. 

Program takes either a .txt file as input or user input from a prompt, and returns a statement on the MATLAB console and a 
.txt file with the result of the calculation.
When writing an equation to either a .txt file or in the prompt, put " " around your equation-- that is, type

integrate "x^2 +2*sin(x)" from 1 to 5

NOT

integrate x^2 +2*sin(x) from 1 to 5.
